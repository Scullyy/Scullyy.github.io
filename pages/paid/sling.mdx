# Sling

Tired of awkwardly stashing your gear where the sun doesn't shine? Say goodbye to uncomfortable weapon placements â€“ embrace the convenience of our weapon sling!

## Features

- Easily customize sling locations through the user-friendly config or the optional, player-centric interface. Put your weapons exactly where you want them.

- Standalone and hassle-free, will work on any server.

- Bridge system for those using frameworks with ox_inventory, qb-inventory and ps-inventory support by default.

- Enjoy synchronized weapon positions across players, complete with attachments, tints, and weapon variants.

- Embrace the ease of auto-slinging weapons onto your back. Say hello to a more practical and comfortable way of carrying your arsenal.

Click [here](https://scullys-development.tebex.io/package/5068532) to purchase the escrowed version or [here](https://scullys-development.tebex.io/package/5100077) to purchase the source.

## Installation Instructions

- Download the resource from [here](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants).

- Unzip the resource, I personally use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

- Drag the resource into your `resources` folder.

- Add `setr scully:uniqueKvpId "change-me"` to your server.cfg and change the "change-me" to something unique (you may have already added this if you have my other resources) to prevent other servers saves from crossing into yours.

- Add `ensure scully_sling` to your `server.cfg` file.

## Events

You can refresh the sling using the below event:
```lua
-- Client sided
TriggerEvent('scully_sling:forceRefresh')

-- Server sided
TriggerClientEvent('scully_sling:forceRefresh', source)
```
