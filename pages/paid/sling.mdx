## Bridge Information

This information is intended for individuals who need a bridge for their inventory system, which operates on items instead of weapons. It is specifically designed for those with a basic understanding of Lua and the functioning of their inventory. Below, you will find details on the functions that can be overridden to transmit the essential information required for the sling to seamlessly integrate with your inventory system.

#### Create a file inside the bridge folder

Create a new file inside the bridge folder and paste the below snippet into it, you will need to edit the text `example_resource` to your inventories resource name.

```lua
if not Config.UseBridge then return end

local custom_state = GetResourceState('example_resource')

if (custom_state == 'missing') or (custom_state == 'unknown') then return end

-- Rest of code goes below here
```

#### Access Data

- `utils.ped` Return the ped entity ID of the current player.

- `utils.playerId` Return the players ID.

- `utils.serverId` Return the players server ID.

- `utils.pedModel` Return the hash of the players current ped model.

- `sling.players[serverId]` Return the defined players slinged weapons as a table.

#### Functions

You will need to re-define the below functions in your bridge so that they can make use of your inventory logic. Examples are provided from our ox_inventory bridge.

**Create a list of weapon components:**

```lua
function sling.getWeaponComponents(hash, componentItems)
    local variant, components = nil, {}

    if componentItems then
        for i = 1, #componentItems do
            local componentItem = componentItems[i]
            local componentData = itemList[componentItem]
            local componentsList = componentData.client.component

            for k = 1, #componentsList do
                local component = componentsList[k]

                if DoesWeaponTakeWeaponComponent(hash, component) then
                    if (componentData.type == 'skin') or (componentData.type == 'upgrade') then
                        variant = component
                    else
                        components[#components + 1] = component
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end

    return variant, components
end
```

The variant needs to be either `nil` or a component hash for a varmod component, keep in mind that some add-on weapons that are advertised as "modular" will need their "modular" parts to be added here also. Any regular components such as scopes, suppressors, flashlights etc... will all need their hashes to be added to the components table.

**Create a list of weapons:**

```lua
function sling.getPlayerWeapons()
    local weapons = {}

    for _, item in pairs(playerInventory) do
        if item then
            local itemName = item.name:lower()
            local weaponHash = itemName:find('weapon_') and joaat(item.name) or false

            if weaponHash then
                local weaponGroup = GetWeapontypeGroup(weaponHash)
                local weaponPoint = Config.AttachPoints[weaponGroup]

                if weaponPoint then
                    local variant, components = sling.getWeaponComponents(weaponHash, item?.metadata?.components)

                    weapons[#weapons + 1] = {
                        slot = item.slot,
                        weapon = weaponHash,
                        weaponPoint = weaponPoint,
                        tint = item?.metadata?.tint,
                        variant = variant,
                        components = components
                    }
                end
            end
        end
    end

    return weapons
end
```

**Refresh all the weapons on your sling:**

```lua
function sling.refreshSling()
    sling.removeWeaponsFromPlayerSling(utils.serverId)

    local updated = false
    local playerWeapons = sling.getPlayerWeapons()

    for i = 1, #playerWeapons do
        local data = playerWeapons[i]
        
        if not currentWeapon?.hash or (data.slot ~= currentWeapon.slot) then
            sling.addWeaponToPlayerSling(utils.serverId, data)

            updated = true
        end
    end

    if updated then
        TriggerServerEvent('scully_sling:updateWeapons', sling.players[utils.serverId])
    end
end
```

**Notifications:**

```lua
function sling.notify(text)
	BeginTextCommandThefeedPost('STRING')
    AddTextComponentSubstringPlayerName(text)
    EndTextCommandThefeedPostTicker(true, true)
end
```

Alternatively you can use our export to change the notification function:

```lua
exports.scully_sling:customNotif(function(text)
    BeginTextCommandThefeedPost('STRING')
    AddTextComponentSubstringPlayerName(text)
    EndTextCommandThefeedPostTicker(true, true)
end)
```

The above are the only functions you will need to override, the following should be left alone but can be used within your bridge.

- `sling.doesSlingContainWeapon(weapon --[[A weapon hash]])` Check if the sling contains a weapon.

- `sling.removeWeaponFromSling(weapon --[[A weapon hash or inventory slot]])` Remove a weapon from the sling.

- `sling.removeWeaponsFromPlayerSling(serverId --[[A players server ID]])` Remove all weapons from the sling.

- `sling.addWeaponToPlayerSling(serverId --[[A players server ID]], data --[[Weapon data using the same format provided in sling.getPlayerWeapons()]])` Add a weapon to the sling.

Whenever a sling is updated make sure you trigger the below event:

```lua
TriggerServerEvent('scully_sling:updateWeapons', sling.players[utils.serverId])
```
